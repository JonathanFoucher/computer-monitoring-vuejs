# computer-monitoring-vuejs

Recently with the hot days of summer, my computer was suffering from the heat and sometimes it was shutting down unexpectedly. My high GPU usage mixed up with the ~35-45Â°C summer temperatures could make my computer shut down many times in a few hours. As a solution I decided to use monitoring tools to watch the temperature of my graphic card and processor. The tools could do the job to show the real time values but I couldn't really make my own board or use multiple charts as I wanted. So I decided to create my own monitoring tool, the target was to code a simple but efficient monitoring tool.

I have already used angluar 7, nodejs and reactjs. I have heard a lot about vuejs and I thought it was a good subject to try it out.
